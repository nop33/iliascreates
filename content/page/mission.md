title: Mission statement
description: My personal mission statement, an experiment to remind myself what is actually important to me in times when what is important gets burried under layers of pressing problems and immediate concerns.
---

- I begin every day with my values and mission in mind.
- I act with integrity.
- I do not react to the circumstantial emotion. I develop personal freedom and consciously choose how to respond.
- I use negative emotions and experiences as an opportunity to grow through self reflection and introspection.
- I do not take anything personally. In moments of criticism and frustration I look for ways to grow instead. I become [unfuckwithable](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Unfuckwithable).
- I do not take life too seriously. _"We come from nothing, we are going back to nothing"_.
- I visualize myself in the position of the other before judging. You never exactly know what a person has been through.
- I listen and think before I speak.
- I respect everyone's freedoms and fight for them.
- I make time for the people I want to keep in my life. I listen to them when they need someone to listen and stand by and support them when in need.
- I am humble.
- I keep learning and growing.
- I waste no time and automate what can be automated. Life is too precious to spend it on mundane things.
- I teach to beginners and learn from the experts.
- I create and inspire.
- In my free time, I work on things that I find interesting. I do not waste time pursuing things that do not interest me.
- I love and care for myself.
- I invest in a healthy body through healthy diet and frequent exercise.
- I expand my understanding of the world by traveling to new places every year.
- I practice daily gratitude for everyone and everything that allows me to have the life that I have today.
- I live out of my imagination rather than my memory.
- Money serve my goals. I do not serve money.
- I take every decision based on my values, principals and mission.
- I give myself a break every now and again. _"Everything in moderation, including moderation"_.
