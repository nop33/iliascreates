- quote: "The problems weface fall in one of three areas: direct control (problems involving our own behavior); indirect control (problems involving other people's behavior); or no control (problems we can do nothing about, such as past). Direct control problems are solved by working on our habits. Indirect control problems are solved by changing our methods of influence. No control problems involve taking the responsibility to change the line on the bottom of our face - to smile, to genuinely and peacefully accept these problems and learn to live with them, even if we don't like them. In this way, we do not empower these problems to control us."
